# Introduction to Data Science, Project 2: To be, or not to be
------------

Classy Shakespeare plays and players

- Set up a data science project structure in a new git repository in your GitHub account
- Download the Shakespeare plays dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays
- Load the data set into panda data frames
- Formulate one or two ideas on how feature engineering would help the data set to establish additional value using exploratory data analysis
- Build one or more classification models to determine the player using the other columns as features
- Document your process and results
- Commit your notebook, source code, visualizations and other supporting files to the git repository in GitHub
